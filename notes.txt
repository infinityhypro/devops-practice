1) What is DevOps?

-> DevOps is a combination of Development and Operations that focuses on improving collaboration between software developers and IT teams.
   It helps in automating the software development process, from building to deployment.
   The main goal is to deliver software faster, more efficiently, and with fewer errors.
   It bridges the gap between development and operations for continuous improvement and delivery

2) 7 Stages of DevOps Lifecycle? 

-> Plan – Identify project requirements and create a roadmap.

   Code – Developers write and manage the application code.

   Build – Code is compiled and converted into executable files.

   Test – Automated tests are run to find and fix bugs. 

   Release – The application is prepared and approved for deployment.

   Deploy – Code is deployed automatically to servers or cloud.

   Operate & Monitor – System performance is tracked and feedback is used to improve the next version.

3) Full form of CI/CD + One Real-Life Example?

-> CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.
   Example: When a developer updates code on GitHub, CI/CD tools like Jenkins automatically test the code and deploy the new version of the app to users — just like how mobile apps get automatic updates after developers push new changes.
